# Seizure validation Framework

This repository illustrates the flow to evaluate a seizure detection algorithm. The different steps and accompanying example code and libraries are documented in the different steps:

1. [Download datasets](1-download.md)
2. [Convert datasets to BIDS](2-convert2bids.md)
3. [Package algorithm and run it on BIDS datasets](3-runSzDetection.md)
4. [Evaluate seizure annotations produced by algorithm](4-evaluate.md)
