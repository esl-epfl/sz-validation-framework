# SzCORE - Seizure validation Framework

This repository illustrates the flow to evaluate a seizure detection algorithm using the SzCORE methodology presented in [*Dan et al. "SzCORE: A Seizure Community Open-source Research Evaluation framework for the validation of EEG-based automated seizure detection algorithms"*](https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.18113). The procedure and accompanying example code and libraries are documented in four steps:

1. [Download datasets](1-download.md)
2. [Convert datasets to BIDS](2-convert2bids.md)
3. [Package algorithm and run it on BIDS datasets](3-runSzDetection.md)
4. [Evaluate seizure annotations produced by algorithm](4-evaluate.md)
